Pre warning, I'm still very new to arch and most of this is taught to me by the powers of 
LLM and a good friend (and of course arch wiki and google) i've cobbled this together 
for a couple reasons.

firstly I want to ensure that i have a copy of what i deem to be my "imporant" config 
files, Secondly i'm doing what i can to learn more about arch and configuring it for my own
needs and wants.

My dotfiles live in /home/dotfiles/.config which is symlinked to ~/.config
