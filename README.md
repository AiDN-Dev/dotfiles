# PRE WARNING
I'm still very new to arch and most of this is taught to me by the powers of 
LLM and a good friend (and of course arch wiki and google) i've cobbled this together 
for a couple reasons.

firstly I want to ensure that i have a copy of what i deem to be my "imporant" config 
files, Secondly i'm doing what i can to learn more about arch and configuring it for my own
needs and wants.

My dotfiles live in `/home/dotfiles/.config` which is symlinked to `~/.config`.

I personally would just copy and paste the relavant bits and pieces, I'm not super comfortable giving 
people instructions to clone and install and all that purely because I dont want to be resposible for 
peoples systems breaking HOWEVER! my good buddy gemini has helpfully provided a few things that might
help if you absouletly must have my config, I'm slowly documenting what packages are in use but it 
should be easy to inferm from the config files whats in use.

## Gemini provided install steps
1. Clone this repo to the `/home/dotfiles` directory, if it doesnt exist create it (assuming this is all symlinked)

    ```sudo mkdir -p /home/dotfiles```
   
    ```sudo chown $user:$USER /home/dotfiles``` - Ensures you own the directory (again this is provided by gemini)
   
    ```git clone https://github.com/AiDN-Dev/dotfiles.git /home/dotfiles```

2. This is an optional step but recommended but backup your current .config using ```mv ~/.config ~/.config_backup$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)```
3. Create the symlink from ```~/.conifg``` to ```/home/dotfiles/``` - THIS IS GENERATED BY GEMINI PLEASE DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE AND RESEARCH CREATING SYMLINKS DONT JUST JUMP INTO THIS LIKE I DID

    ```ln -s /home/dotfiles ~/.config```
4. Install dependancies - Either use the list at the bottom of this readme (LOL this is still being updated) or go through the .config files and it should be pretty easy to tell whats in use then just install them with your fav package manager (I use yay)

    for example ```yay -S starship```

5. Reboot or restart services
